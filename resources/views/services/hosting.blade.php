            <p class="hosting-page-section-1-left-info">Search Engine Optimisation or SEO is the process of getting 'traffic' from natural search results on search engines such as Google. This is <strong>not</strong> the same as paid search ads, instead it focuses on the design and presentation of your website to ensure it ranks highly in Google searches.</p>
